<blockquote>
<p>[A] blitzkrieg against core functions of the state, operating
largely outside the boundaries set by history, precedent, and
constitutional law, and designed to reduce the shape and purpose of
government power to the whims, and spite, of a single man. Or perhaps
two men.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That newspaper was hardly the only mainstream outlet relying on the
moment's most salient military metaphor. Would we echo this blitzkrieg
discourse to describe the whirlwind of executive actions, the storm
within the administrative agencies, and the spectacular bluster coming
from the U.S. federal government? I think we should. <br />
<br />
But first, let's distinguish our position from that of the liberals.
Lately, the typical use of the term "blitzkrieg" reflects, in large
part, the shock of loss that Democrats are experiencing. Steve Bannon
gleefully explained this as an intended effect of the MAGA strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you're winning, it's like blitzkrieg... They're surrendering
without a fight. This is extraordinary, and that's their urgency: You
got to keep pounding. Don't let them up. Don't let them have a breath.
Don't let them regroup. Don't let them organize.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly, in the face of the blitzkrieg, the liberals can't stop Trump now.
It's just like Denmark's historic inability to stop the Nazis. The
Democratic Party is in crisis. But we don't own their electoral loss,
and we can't do anything about their powerlessness. <br />
<br />
A major reason liberals are bound to keep losing is that they're
myopically focused on the blitzkrieg's illegality. Laurence Tribe
described Trump as "the most lawless and scofflaw president we have ever
seen."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> For Noah Millman in the <em>New York Times</em>, "[t]he question
is whether [the Trump blitzkrieg] will transform our constitutional
order fruitfully yet again or accelerate a final degeneration into
Caesarism." For us, on the other hand, we wouldn't defend the neoliberal
<em>status quo ante</em> — except maybe insofar as it provided easier terrain
for us to navigate. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution isn't
his greatest crime. Rather, we're responding to his amplified repression
and how he's consolidated power around a certain pole of economic
nationalism.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup> <br />
<br />
We also recognize that the mainstream media trades in hyperbole,
outrage, and moralism. David Wallace-Wells admits in his February 5
piece that, "[a]t the moment, it is hard to see it but
hysterically.<em>"</em> For us, the media's clichés are generally distractions
when what we need is analysis. <br />
<br />
And yet, we have a few reasons to embrace the term blitzkrieg. First, we
register the actions of Trump, Musk, and this new authoritarian
rightwing movement in January through March as if they were also
attacks... <em>on us actual "leftists," as well as on ordinary
proletarians in general</em>. They don't know us very well and their
rhetoric shows they certainly don't understand us, but it seems clear
that we are the real enemies they militate against. The disappearances
and attempted deportations of Mahmoud Khalil and other participants in
the Gaza solidarity movement are the evidence of this. The more
idealistic among the Trumpists (Thiel, Yarvin, Bannon) seek to forge an
autocratic state that ruthlessly polices and exploits its proletarians.
The more pragmatic ones see opportunities for power and personal profit.
They haven't won our consent. So, to everyone in that coalition, we are
an obstacle to those ambitions, a problem to be solved. <br />
<br />
Second, though a cliché, "blitzkrieg" nicely captures the shock of these
attacks. The word evokes the terror of being overwhelmed by an
unanticipated oppositional force, the chaos in our camp. We imagine the
noise of tanks, artillery, and aircraft. The blitzkrieg renders our
resistance fragmented and uncoordinated. Material defeat is coupled with
psychological pain, disorientation, the loss of control and hope. It
interrupts the rhythms of daily life, breaks time — moments and days
advance suddenly, without affording any period of reflection. That's
what it feels like lately. Laurence Tribe is overwhelmed by the task of
addressing all of the administration's illegal acts ("The very fact that
the illegal actions have come out with the speed of a rapidly firing
Gatling gun makes it very hard for people to focus on any one of them.
That's obviously part of the strategy," he writes). For us, there is a
rapid upending of our lives, projects, and strategic interventions. We
marvel at the fast pace of change, and only too late do we recognize our
unpreparedness. We are not ready to answer the burning questions of the
moment. <br />
<br />
When Trump was reelected, political analysts predicted economic disaster
and corollary civil unrest. At the time, we knew it would be naive to
assume that everything Trump threatened would actually happen. We also
knew it was equally foolish to ignore the potential and actual threats
presented by his victory. We saw <em>something</em> coming, but didn't know
what it would be. It was spectacle, no less so for our recognition of
this fact. <br />
<br />
Once in office, the administration didn't delay in implementing its
plans. Trump signed an executive order that denies the constitutional
birthright to citizenship. The Senate is now
pushing forward a budget that funds mass deportations and a border wall.
Trump's allies propose camps. They want to deputize 10,000 private
citizens, empowering them to round up their neighbors. Trump removed a
member of the NLRB, denying it quorum, emboldening Amazon to refuse to
recognize unions. The EEOC will sue to stop what it calls
"discrimination" against Christians and white people. Musk does the Nazi
salute and helms the absurd DOGE. MAGA shitheads celebrate chauvinistic
nationalism and white supremacy. The right is ascendant and it feels
like we are surrounded. <br />
<br />
Trump's blitzkrieg forces us to become reactive, impairing our inquiry.
How does labor organize without an NLRB?<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#8">8</a></sup> Where is it safe for
pregnant, queer, and/or trans people? What can we do for our friends and
family who are losing their jobs? Where are the ICE raids and
deportations happening this week? These are all pertinent questions, of
course; we need to answer them. But it's also worth pausing to reflect.
As always, we must analyze the conjuncture while we strategize and
respond creatively. <br />
<br />
So, here's a deeper reason why the metaphor "blitzkrieg" is apt for us
to describe the Trump strategy: shock and awe can make it hard to assess
the material realities. For us, a substantial part of our problem is
confusion about how to grapple with a political spectacle that obscures
the concrete work Trump and his world have done. As historians now
recognize, the German army never articulated a military doctrine of
blitzkrieg.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#9">9</a></sup> Hitler is reported to have derided the term, calling it
"completely idiotic."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#10">10</a></sup> To the Germans at the start of World War
II, the invasions were simply about applying available technology and
capacity to the battlefield. Military units were carefully positioned
and forces energized, then unleashed. The opposing armies, though
numerically superior in some cases, were simply outmaneuvered. Reeling
from defeat, the word "blitzkrieg" was invented by non-Germans to
describe the attacks. <br />
<br />
Like Germany's neighbors, we're also victims of the psychological
dimension of blitzkrieg. Although we knew <em>something</em> was coming, we're
still struggling to think clearly and recognize that these attacks
didn't come out of nowhere. The right's strategy is the logical
application of its power. And, frankly, the architects of this moment
had drafted a plan well in advance. Trump, while puerile and lacking a
consistent ideology, is a skilled political organizer. He held dozens of
large rallies in 2024, raised over a billion dollars, defeated
challengers and folded them into his project. Musk constantly vents
sheer idiocy, yet he's the wealthiest person alive and controls one of
the few social media platforms with mass reach. The MAGA movement has a
cadre of professional operatives, some of whom are young and energized
while others are savvy and experienced. <br />
<br />
Some of us were surprised that such an ambitious and profoundly
unpopular project could ascend to such heights of power. The architects of Project 2025 were not
surprised; they were prepared. Describing the Department of State in the
Project 2025 <em>Mandate for Leadership</em>, Kiron K. Skinner frames the
incoming Trump administration as a minoritarian faction within the
broader U.S. State bureaucracy. She anticipated stark resistance to a
"conservative" agenda because "large swaths of the State Department's
workforce are left-wing."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#11">11</a></sup> (Though, of course, "left" means
something entirely different to us, the point here is that they are
internal enemies.) Nevertheless, the MAGA Right built a sufficiently strong coalition
that they are now dictating the policies of American government. They
are playing by Carl Schmitt's rules: as the sovereign, Trump gets to
define the exceptions. They planned to have Trump sign these 70-some
executive orders immediately upon taking office. Will they be deemed
legal? Does it matter? There's no legal barrier to a <em>fait accompli</em>.
They don't need to win all hearts and minds. In a hegemonic struggle,
the powers that be are not trying to get you to agree that they're
right; they're trying to convince you that they're the only way out of a
crisis. The point of Trump's blitzkrieg is to make us ask "Why even
bother?" <br />
<br />
Here's why we bother: the question of political limits is a question of
social force. We still can build our social force. As Stuart Hall said,
"no victories are permanent or final."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#12">12</a></sup> The point now is to resist
the idea that we've lost the battle before it's even begun. Now is the
time to bother our enemies. <br />
