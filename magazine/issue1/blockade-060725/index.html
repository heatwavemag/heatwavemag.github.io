unlike last time the sky was already light, dawn had just passed. We
were in the middle of a regional industrial zone that was already alive
with machinery churning, trucks arriving and departing, and workers from
various sites smoking or drinking coffee at the gates. As we walked down
the road to Bisalloy Steels, where the picket would be, a friend struck
up a conversation with some men on the street. They had heard about the
picket happening down the road, but weren't too keen on discussing the
basis of it: better things to do with their short time on 'smoko'. In
the distance we could see some comrades already gathered at the gates of
Bisalloy. 
<br />
<br />
It felt good to see their numbers already growing. In the week leading
up to the picket, we had received intel from workers and unions at
Bisalloy that the company was saying they had to cross the picket line.
The night before we again had it confirmed that operations would
continue, the bosses having issued an ultimatum that if workers didn't
cross the line, they'd have to take leave or go unpaid. So we had
expected there would be some conflict today, most likely with the police
as they sought to break the picket. We came prepared, with pallets and
other materials to reinforce the barricades. 
<br />
<br />
But as we arrived it was impossible not to notice how quiet it was. The
usual industrial clamour of the steel treatment plant, the hiss and
stamp of the machinery, was silent beyond the fence. All doors were
closed, signals that no work was underway were lit up, and no one was
inside. Few police were visible, scattered up and down the street. A
piece of paper on the office door proclaimed, "Closed for the day for
annual company picnic".
<br />
<br />
What had happened? Were they really closed once again? Had just the
threat of another picket been enough for them to shut up shop?

<p>In Australia, as across the world, a massive wave of struggle rose
against the genocide in Palestine, comprised of a wide constellation of
political groups and practices. Compared to previous iterations of
Palestine solidarity here, this wave has been more widespread, involving
a broader range of tactics. These included regular rallies and marches
across major cities, student encampments at several universities, an
encampment at the Prime Minister's office, pickets and blockades of key
infrastructure, and smaller scale actions involving lock-ons, targeted
property damage and sabotage, among other practices. 
<br />
<br />
Pickets here have traditionally been divided into trade union pickets
and community pickets. Trade union pickets are organised by unions,
usually while involved in legal industrial actions, during strikes or to
challenge lock-outs. Due to the repressive legal context in Australia,
the only legal pickets that unions can organise are during a specific
time of bargaining, usually every 3 or 4 years.
<br />
<br />
Community pickets can occur to support workers in an industrial campaign
where legal restrictions limit the actions of unions. In this case,
community pickets are often a tactic endorsed by a union and used to
further its campaign. Another type of community picket is organised and
run by the 'community', i.e. people from outside the picketed workplace
organising and participating in the picket themselves. It is only the
latter type that has been used in the Palestine solidarity movement.
<br />
<br />
The first call for a blockade and community picket came in November
2023, targeting the Zionist shipping company ZIM. Simultaneous calls for
port blockades in both Melbourne and Sydney were made to prevent the
loading and unloading of various ZIM ships. Initially, the calls
resulted only in protests outside the port, without disrupting the
shipping line at all. Soon, however, pickets were attempted at each
port. 
<br /></p>

    <figcaption>Since these early pickets in November 2023, the tactic has spread to
other industrial areas in Australia.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At Port Botany, in Sydney, two community pickets were held. While these
were not trade union pickets, the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) was
involved in both. The MUA is the most militant union in Australia, and
its Sydney branch is particularly left-leaning. Their support bolstered
confidence, but police broke both pickets and arrested dozens of
participants, including MUA branch officials.
<br />
<br />
It's worth noting that in New South Wales (NSW, where Sydney and
Wollongong are located), certain economic zones and infrastructure are
designated "protected" and subject to stronger anti-protest laws.
Incidents at these sites carry heavier fines and a higher likelihood of
imprisonment. The ports in Sydney are subject to such laws.  While it
was significant that these pickets challenged the laws, and welcome that
the MUA played a role, the number of arrests and the character of
repression has meant that no further action has taken place at Port
Botany since March 2024.
<br />
<br />
In Melbourne (in the state of Victoria), the situation with port actions
has been different. The first picket there involved "actionists" (a term
some Australian leftists use to distinguish themselves from "activists"
by emphasizing direct action), MUA members, and others. For the first
few days, it appears the MUA branch told its members at the port to
honour the picket, but after the picket was broken by police on the
third day it was not reestablished. The picket provoked debates along
factional as well as tactical lines as to how much deferral to union
members there should be, and which tactics and practices were legitimate
on the picket.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
<br />
<br />
Since these early pickets in November 2023, the tactic has spread to
other ports and industrial areas in Victoria and NSW, as well as Queensland and other
states/territories. The pickets organised at Bisalloy differ from those
outlined above, providing insights into other ways that this tactic can
disrupt supply chains.

<p>Bisalloy Steels is located in the Illawarra region of NSW, in the
Wollongong suburb called Unanderra. It produces hardened, 'quenched and
tempered' steel used for both military and civilian applications,
including armoured vehicles, watch towers, panic rooms, and jail/prison
infrastructure.
<br />
<br />
The company purchases steel 'coil' from BlueScope Steel (located at Port
Kembla, also in the Illawarra), treating it with high heat and chemical
reactivity. Bisalloy product is predominantly used in military vehicles
such as Merkeva and Boxer-CRV tanks, and so-called 'civilian defence
vehicles', such as retrofitted armoured cars produced by Plasan Reem.
The absolute devastation wrought by Israel's Merkevas in Gaza and the
West Bank is now well known. The use of civilian armoured cars, however,
may not be initially apparent. 
<br />
<br />
These vehicles are popular in illegal settlements across Palestine,
facilitating their expansion and allowing settlers to move across the
country with impunity. In the hands of Israeli occupiers, armoured
vehicles function as weapons. They are used to harass and threaten
journalists trying to document settlers' activities. Olive farmers often
describe the first sign of settlers descending on the harvest as the
glint of sunlight on these vehicles swooping down from the ridges where
many settlements are located, and into the valleys where olive trees
grow. The quenched and tempered steel covering the car's chassis allows
for the mounting of launchers for tear gas canisters, for ramming
ancient trees, and for protecting the occupants from incendiary devices
settlers launch into fields to burn olive groves.
<br />
<br />
The company engages in two-way trade with Israel. For example, in 2023,
Bisalloy contracted Plasan Reem to assist in the building of naval
frigates for the Australian Navy. In addition to their existing
provisions to the Zionist entity, Bisalloy's product guides increasingly
hint at their product's possible application in incarceration
technologies — cells, secure rooms, and watchtowers.
<br />
<br />
Under the banner 'No Illawarra Steel for Genocide', a network called
Wollongong Friends of Palestine has organised a series of pickets at the
Bisalloy Steels factory in Unanderra.

<p>The wave of Palestine solidarity has seen the largest street
mobilisations in Australia since protests against Australian involvement
in the Second Gulf War. Like elsewhere, Wollongong had weekly protests
in the streets, drawing several hundred people each (a consistent number
for a regional city of 300,000). The families and friends who connected
at the rallies had previously organised a community <em>iftar</em>
(fast-breaking dinner during Ramadan), mass postering at a local
politician's office, and an evening vigil. The rallies in turn became an
open organising base for other actions, including the Bisalloy pickets.
<br />
<br />
After each of the weekly rallies, planning meetings were made accessible
to a wide array of locals interested in advancing the struggle. The open
format allowed participants to develop an environment where everyone
felt able to contribute to discussion, to debate tactics and objectives,
and to disagree freely. The practice of debate, which involved both
regular and irregular participants in the planning process, contributed
to propagating the idea that a picket/blockade of Bisalloy could be
successful, while also building decision-making infrastructure that
would become important on the picket lines. Mass, open organising <em>of</em>
the pickets enabled mass, open organising <em>at</em> the pickets.
<br />
<br />
The meetings also allowed for a cross-pollination of people and ideas
where the possibility of undertaking the picket became more realistic
for more people. Weekly protests drew a variety of people, many of whom
had never been involved in direct action of any sort before. Rallies
served as an entry point, and the weekly open meetings built trust,
while consistent conversations about disruptive tactics built courage
and interest. Finally, picket training and skill shares built the
capacity for mass, militant action. 
<br />
<br />
The process of preparing for the pickets had to be <em>consistent,</em> <em>slow</em>,
and <em>steady</em>. At first, there was a sense from some that it would not be
feasible to disrupt the production and circulation of materials at
Bisalloy. They argued that a protest outside of the factory would be
more viable. It took ongoing conversations — in cars, during marches or
trainings, whilst we cooked iftar meals during Ramadan — to work through
this perception and emerge with a collective sense of readiness for a
little more risk-taking. Though not everyone was ready to take the same
risks at the same time, our collective arrived at a point where we felt
that trying to fully shut down Bisalloy was possible. 
<br />
<br />
Our approach to organising the pickets, aiming for a practice of mass
action with an internal articulation of autonomy, sought to navigate
beyond the apparent binary that seemed dominant in the wake of Israel's
2023 invasion of Gaza. This binary tended to pose participation as
either passive or limited to a closed group supported by observers.
While rallies could be important, they tended to involve a kind of
passive participation for the majority of people present. Alternatively,
closed affinity groups were capable of impressive actions of disruption,
but rarely fostered a practice of widespread participation in militancy.
We hoped to develop more widespread participation in the picket, while
also encouraging people to take initiative with further actions.
<br />
<br />
The approach to the pickets aimed to break down as much as possible the
division between "organisers" and "the organised", or between planners
and participants. In so far as the struggle against capitalism
cultivates the formation of collective bodies of class power that could
become vehicles of revolutionary action, we have sought to build the
pickets as one such instance of this power: an organ of struggle in its
own right. This has involved creating participatory political spaces,
including the pickets themselves, where everyone present has the ability
to contribute meaningfully to decisions, to contribute materially as
they are able, and to use a variety of methods to shut down IDF supply
chains. We have aimed to promote mass action with an internal
articulation of autonomy as a method of class movement away from simply
observing actions planned and controlled by others, and to initiate mass
action that we navigate collectively.

<p>There have been five pickets and three other actions at Bisalloy since
October 2023. There was an office occupation, which emerged from an open
community meeting but was not publicly advertised in December 2023. In
April 2024, a group entered the facilities and locked on to machinery,
disrupting operations for several hours and prompting the company to
build an extra security fence. The pickets aimed to build off these
actions, while also taking a different approach.
<br />
<br />
The first two pickets were limited in duration to three hours from 6:00
to 9:00 a.m., seeking to interrupt the morning change of shift and
prevent any materials from entering or leaving the factory (though each
picket ended up lasting longer). The third picket was called for twelve
hours, from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. And the last two pickets were
open-ended from 6:00 a.m. Decisions about the length of each picket were
made through discussion in our planning meetings, reflecting on the
lessons of each previous picket. 
<br />
<br />
Bisalloy is not a large industrial site, but it stretches a couple of
hundred meters along an industrial road. There are two vehicle gates
spaced about 150 meters apart, and an office entrance between them. It
was necessary to have enough numbers to be able to block all entrances,
and we also needed ways to communicate across the pickets. We prepared
simple systems of communication, through delegates whose role was simply
to share information to the common channel about needs and updates from
each gate. The picket at each gate functioned as its own hub for
deciding how to run that picket. Within this wider system of
communication and decision-making, affinity groups could make their own
decisions on how to act.
<br />
<br />
Decisions during the pickets, to the extent they were necessary, were
made collectively through meetings at individual gates and across the
whole picket. These decisions were made through discussion and, where
possible, consensus. At the same time, there was no pretence that these
decisions would be binding for everyone. 
<br />
<br />
Meetings allowed for clarity on what we knew about the site that day
(for example, when we had been told in advance the site would be shut)
or to gather observations from the whole picket (Were there cars in the
carpark? Were the factory's roller doors open?). Picket meetings were also convened to discuss potential challenges to
the picket from cops or others. 
<br />
<br />
For example, when a cop tried to intimidate a small group of the first
picketers to arrive on site, we held a meeting on one of the site's
driveways to decide how to respond. It was quickly proposed that we
would begin our hard picket, with anyone reluctant to step onto the
driveway remaining on the grass. Affinity groups quickly moved towards
the driveways, and the picket continued unchallenged. 
<br />
<br />
The pickets have been successful, but it has been a strange success.
Each time, hundreds of people have turned out to participate. During the
first two shorter pickets, nothing moved in or out of the gates. When we
called longer or indefinite pickets, the company shut operations
completely for those days. While we prepared for confrontation with
police and other hostilities, it turned out that neither the police nor
anyone else has posed a serious challenge to any of the pickets. Each
time, we assembled at each gate, blocking all entrances to the site, and
waited for a confrontation that never came. Aside from the one attempt
to intimidate picketers into leaving the site, mentioned above, no
threat has been made and production has been stopped on five occasions.
<br />
<br />
This lack of confrontation may be partly explained by the numbers of
people turning up to the pickets. It may also reflect that, while the
workers employed at Bisalloy have not participated, they have played a
role. In the lead-up to each picket, we have communicated with workers
at the site, with the unions that have coverage there, and the South
Coast Labour Council (SCLC — a regional council to which trade unions
affiliate). In this way, we were able to learn what to expect. For
example, we were told on various occasions that at least some of the
workers were sympathetic, even though they were not participating. Prior
to the picket in September, we were told that the company had decided to
close for the day. On a later occasion, we were informed that the
company was insisting workers cross the picket line — though in the end
the company closed on that occasion too. It may be the case that
sympathies within the shop played a role in shutting operations. 
<br />
<br />
It is also worth noting that the SCLC took the interesting step of
initiating an audit into worker exposure to war crime prosecution due to
employment in industries implicated in the genocide. This opened the
possibility, within the legal framework of industrial law, for workers
to refuse work that put them at risk of prosecution. Unfortunately, no
one has taken up this opportunity.
<br />
<br />
Another factor is that the openly organised and public mobilisations for
the pickets played a role in influencing the company's decisions. The
open publication of the call to shut down operations at Bisalloy in
defiance of the law, as well as the openness of preparatory meetings,
likely played a positive role not only in building confidence in the
actions, but also in spooking the company.
<br />
<br />
Given the lack of challenges to the pickets, on each occasion they ended
up being more like street parties, with the road overtaken by picketers,
music, art, discussions, kids spaces, and meals provided by Food Not
Bombs. The success of the pickets has meant that certain organisational
measures remain untested, such as our capacity to resist police attempts
to break the picket line, to practice the organisational principles of
participatory decision-making alongside autonomous action, and to
maintain and expand the pickets in a context of stronger repression.

<p>A common criticism of community pickets is that they are weak,
especially when compared to industrial actions taken by workers employed
at the picketed site. For example, a recent article by the Melbourne
Anarchist Communist Group argued that, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The community" is also a poor substitute for working class
organisation. Community blockades of manufacturing sites, ports and
other infrastructure correctly identify the importance of disrupting
production but they lack the power to achieve what they set out to do.
A community blockade (unsupported by workers at the blockaded site)
lasts as long as it takes the police to break it up.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While we do not disagree that workers at these factories taking action
would be very welcome, powerful, and an important step in class
struggle, the fact of the matter is, aside from the MUA-supported
actions mentioned earlier (which were broken by police), not one
industrial action of that nature has taken place. Under current
circumstances in Australia, the police don't even have to break up
industrial actions, as the character of industrial laws has already made
it extremely unlikely that such actions occur. Of course we should
support such actions whenever possible, but this sort of critique tends
to abstract from the existing terrain of class struggle that we can see
in front of us.
<br />
<br />
Moreover, the notion that community pickets do not create a point of
tension where workers employed at the site might take action is
ill-founded. To take the example of Bisalloy, we can see how the
community pickets have contributed to some, albeit not enough, movement
by workers and their official representatives.  Given the lack of direct
worker action in these sites, and the inability/unwillingness of unions
to break out of the legal binds on formal industrial action, community
pickets do constitute a means of rebuilding class power appropriate to
the contemporary class composition of deindustrialised regions, where
shopfloor modes of organisation no longer hold the power they once did.
<br />
<br />
The condition of the proletariat is not synonymous with the status of
being an employee. From a communist viewpoint, limiting the
consideration of working-class organisation and power to employees is
problematic. The law of value and the rule of capital operate at the
level of a totality, across the social factory. In this context the
production, reproduction and circulation of capital are all constituted
as terrains of class struggle. Class movement involves the construction
of organs of power that challenge capital, as well as the negation of
our condition as variable capital subject to the law of value. Such
modes of organisation necessarily involve, but are not limited to, the
shop floor. Given that the proletarian condition extends beyond the
workplace across the social factory, articulating a communist politics
must avoid reductive notions of class organisation.
<br />
<br />
Of course, a challenge that the Bisalloy pickets have confronted is how
to develop stronger proletarian relations across the gates of the
factory. We can look to examples of class organisation that involve but
also exceed the workplace in grappling with this challenge, such as the
NSW Builders Labourers Federation of the 1970s. The BLF took up 'green
bans' (refusal to work on projects that would harm the natural or
cultural environment, including disruption of proletarian
neighbourhoods), as well as women's and queer liberation struggles, as
key organising objectives, demonstrating how proletarian relations could
become a part of class movement within and beyond the workplace.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
Wollongong's own history as a working-class town also provides lessons,
where the Wollongong Out of Workers' Union struggled for both the right
to work and the refusal of it.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Class alliances across the boundary
between the neighbourhood and the shopfloor have been pivotal in the
reduction of toxic production practices that poisoned everyone in
proximity to the industrial zones of Port Kembla. These histories offer
some guidance for developing the politics of the Bisalloy pickets. At
the same time, we would suggest that it is precisely the reality of
proletarian relations within and beyond the shopfloor developed over the
course of Wollongong's history that has contributed to the success of
the pickets so far.
<br />
<br />
Finally, community pickets can articulate proletarian internationalism
against the social factory — in this case, against capital's military
supply lines that connect proles within and outside of Wollongong's
factories to the atrocities facing our fellows in Gaza. Without
overstating the significance of the pickets, they do constitute a form
of class organisation appropriate to the conditions in Wollongong today.

<p>Once again, we gathered in the pre-dawn twilight across the driveway at
Bisalloy. The police took their positions along the street. A hundred of
us discussed the fact that, for the first time, we had received no
information about whether the factory would be open or closed today,
whether our picket was likely to be challenged. We agreed to take our
positions across the three entrances and wait. 
<br />
<br />
Early signs were good. There were no cars in the employee carpark, the
enormous roller doors were closed, and no one could be seen moving
around the site. A solitary hardhat sat on the picnic table where
workers often take their lunch. We settled in. Discussion groups started
at various gates; bands played at the entrance to the office. It was a
hard picket, a demonstration, and a radical street festival, all in
one. 
<br />
<br />
During our second meeting of the day, around 8:30 a.m., a picketer
called Bisalloy's front office. With the phone on speaker, everyone got
quiet and leaned in. Closed for 48 hours, we were told, due to "the
protestors". Later, we learned through the unions that workers had been
sent offsite for training. Our picket ended at 10:30 a.m., and no
workers entered the site the rest of the day, or the next day either.
With this latest picket, we have shut Bisalloy down for nearly 100 hours
over 2024 and 2025.
<br />
<br />
Another picket has been set for May 8, 2025.
