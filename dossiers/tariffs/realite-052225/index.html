unjustified. Yet what has come to be known as the "Miran
Doctrine" &mdash; named after the current administration's chief economic
adviser &mdash; suggests that things are not so simple. His forty-page
document lays out two essential arguments: first, that the April 2<sup>nd</sup> announcements do indeed follow a clear strategic roadmap; and second,
that the tariffs in question serve a purpose that goes well beyond
traditional trade policy. <a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<br />
<br />
We won't revisit here in detail the announcements that rattled Wall
Street, nor the partial backtracking that followed, along with its real
or supposed causes. Suffice it to say that this reversal was only
partial, and that the implementation of the "reciprocal" tariffs, as of
this writing, has merely been postponed.
<br />
<br />
Reading the "Miran Doctrine" struck us as necessary to grasp the Trump
administration's approach. The handful of interpretations circulating
tends to take the document at face value &mdash; seeing in it either the grand
plan of a villain or the roadmap of a savior. Our aim here is to move
beyond such superficial readings. We offer a concise summary of the
document and attempt to unpack its wider implications and stakes.
<br />
<br />
<p><strong>The "Miran Doctrine" 101</strong></p>
<p>Stephen Miran, now chair of the White House Council of Economic
Advisers, had already worked at the Treasury Department during Trump's
first term. The document we will examine is titled <a href="https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf"><em>A User's Guide to
Restructuring the Global Trading
System</em></a>,
published in November 2024 by Hudson Bay Capital's research division,
the investment fund where Miran worked during the Biden administration.
Since the current administration took office, however, various official
statements and papers from Miran have closely echoed the themes and
framework of <em>A User's Guide</em>. In this sense, it's reasonable to treat
the document as a de facto roadmap for key areas of the administration's
economic policy.
<br />
<br />
As we noted above, the analysis and policy recommendations in this
document extend far beyond trade. In fact, they address the major
commercial, financial, and monetary (dis)equilibria that define
globalization — equilibria the United States played a central role in
shaping. Crucially, they do so from a perspective that challenges
liberal orthodoxy on multiple fronts. Hence, one finds in the text a
redistributive vision, a critique of finance (Wall Street vs. Main
Street), and of the deindustrialization that has afflicted the U.S. over
recent decades. One can also discern the outline of a nationalist social
compromise between segments of industrial capital and the American
working class. It is worth noting how tightly the analysis is focused on
domestic conditions and indicators — trade balances, for instance. This
focus may seem paradoxical, given the sprawling global reach of U.S.
capital. We will return to this.
<br />
<br />
At the heart of the "Miran Doctrine" lies a reversal of the usual view
of the U.S. dollar. Rather than seeing it as an "exorbitant privilege,"
Miran presents it as an <em>exorbitant burden</em>. The conventional wisdom
holds that global demand for dollars — particularly in the form of U.S.
Treasury bonds — is a consequence of trade imbalances that leave various
countries in a creditor position vis-à-vis the United States. According
to this view, it is the weakness of U.S. exports, combined with the size
and openness of the American market, that generates foreign trade
surpluses, which are then recycled into Treasuries and other
dollar-denominated assets.
<br />
<br />
Miran flips this causality: he treats trade imbalances as a consequence
of the dollar's international role. By supplying the world with its
reserve currency and Treasury securities, the United States provides a
kind of service to the rest of the world. But this service comes at a
cost — most significantly, a chronically overvalued dollar. As Miran
puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The deep unhappiness with the prevailing economic order is rooted in
persistent overvaluation of the dollar and asymmetric trade
conditions. Such overvaluation makes U.S. exports less competitive,
U.S. imports cheaper, and handicaps American manufacturing.
Manufacturing employment declines as factories close. Those local
economies subside, many working families are unable to support
themselves and become addicted to government handouts or opioids"<a href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To support this view, Miran draws on a variant of what monetary
theorists call the <em>Triffin dilemma</em>, named after economist Robert
Triffin (1911-1993). In his 1960 book <em>Gold and the Dollar Crisis</em>,
Triffin argued that no national currency can serve as a global currency
indefinitely because its domestic and international functions will
inevitably come into conflict. Normally, cross-border flows of
money — via trade, foreign direct investment, tourism, etc. — cause a
currency to appreciate or depreciate. But a currency that plays a global
role must always be available in sufficient quantities to facilitate
transactions and act as a reserve asset. This structural demand props up
its value, even when outflows would normally weaken it. Under Bretton
Woods, this contradiction was temporarily managed by linking the dollar
to gold at a fixed rate ($35 per ounce). But Triffin foresaw that
global demand for dollars would ultimately outpace U.S. gold reserves.
Other countries would then try to convert their dollar holdings into
gold, only to discover there wasn't enough to go around. This, he
predicted, would bring an end to the dollar's role as the world's anchor
currency.
<br />
<br />
This gold rush did effectively take place between 1965 and 1971.
However, what Triffin didn't foresee was that the U.S. could reinvent
its monetary and economic supremacy not as a global creditor (as it did
under Bretton Woods), but as a global debtor. Such is the regime we've
lived under since the Reagan era, with persistent twin deficits (budget
and current account). For Miran, the Triffin dilemma has not
disappeared, however — it has simply taken a new form: []{.mark}"America
runs large current account deficits not because it imports too much, but
it imports too much because it must export USTs to provide reserve
assets and facilitate global growth."<a href="#footnote-3"><sup>3</sup></a> In other words, the dollar's
expanding global role in the age of globalization — post-Cold War,
post-China's opening — has come at the expense of U.S. manufacturing
competitiveness.
<br />
<br />
Miran is far from blind to the dollar's advantages. He understands that
its reserve currency status allows the U.S. government to borrow heavily
and at low interest rates. He also knows that its use in global
transactions gives Washington the ability to pass part of its foreign
policy through its currency (this is the "weaponization" of the dollar,
visible most clearly in sanctions against Russia). Contrary to what a
strict reading of the Triffin dilemma might imply, Miran does not
propose sacrificing the dollar's international status in the name of
domestic economic revival. On the contrary, it is precisely this
international leverage he wants to deploy, arguing that the U.S. can
[]{.mark}"achieve foreign policy ends of weakening enemies without
having to mobilize a single soldier."<a href="#footnote-4"><sup>4</sup></a> The doctrine's ultimate aim,
then, is to weaken the dollar's value <em>without</em> forfeiting its
privileges. But how can one have both at the same time?
<br />
<br />
Miran proposes a two-step strategy. First, he argues, the U.S. should
tightly link its military umbrella and tariff regime — making access to
security conditional on compliance with economic demands. Second, it
should initiate an international negotiation to coordinate a devaluation
of the dollar.
<br />
<br />
The first step involves imposing tariffs. Their precise levels are of
secondary concern. As Miran repeatedly notes, tariffs are not an end in
themselves, but rather bargaining chips for a future "deal," or failing
that, for bilateral agreements. Tariffs, in his view, can serve as a
lever not only in trade negotiations, but also in foreign policy more
broadly. He gives a range of examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Does the nation apply similar tariff rates to their imports from the
U.S. as America does on their exports here?", "Does the nation pay its
NATO obligations in full? Does the nation side with China, Russia, and
Iran in key international disputes, for instance at the United
Nations?", or "Do the nation's leaders grandstand against the United
States in the international theater?"<a href="#footnote-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Miran's view, even if negotiations fail and retaliation follows, the
U.S. can still benefit. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Suppose the U.S. levels tariffs on NATO partners and threatens to
weaken its NATO joint defense obligations if it is hit with
retaliatory tariffs. If Europe retaliates but dramatically boosts its
own defense expenditures and capabilities, alleviating the United
States' burden for global security and threatening less overextension
of our capabilities, it will have accomplished several goals. Europe
taking a greater role in its own defense allows the U.S. to
concentrate more on China, which is a far greater economic and
national security threat to America than Russia is, while generating
revenue."<a href="#footnote-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bold strategy that cannot be implemented without
turbulence — including on the domestic front. In mainstream commentary,
it is often said that tariffs have an inflationary effect for American
consumers. <a href="https://alertacomunista.wordpress.com/2025/04/18/tariffonomicon/">As others have pointed out before
us</a>,<a href="#footnote-7"><sup>7</sup></a>
this is something of a mischaracterization. "Inflation" — whether high
or low — refers to a relatively sustained rise in producer and consumer
prices. The introduction of a tariff, by contrast, affects only the
prices of the goods to which it applies, and only once. The effect is no
different from any other indirect tax — like VAT or fuel taxes. One
might object that the consequences for consumers are the same either
way, but that is not quite accurate: in one case we have a steady
transfer of income from buyer to state, while in the other, what is at
stake is a growing erosion of the denominator in which that income is
expressed. Moreover, from the state's point of view, it is far simpler
to roll back an unpopular tax (as in the case of the ecotax that sparked
the Yellow Vests movement in 2018) than to bring inflation back down
once it has taken hold.
<br />
<br />
In any case, Miran envisions a set of measures to counter this
supposedly "inflationary" effect of tariffs. Beyond tax cuts, especially
for struggling households, he includes measures like the deregulation of
domestic energy production to boost the supply of oil and gas and drive
prices down. Miran also considers a potential appreciation of the
dollar, which at first glance might appear to contradict his core
argument. During the first Trump administration (in 2018--2019), tariffs
on Chinese goods were largely offset by a depreciation of the renminbi
relative to the dollar. The kind of dollar appreciation he now
anticipates would be temporary, serving only to absorb the one-time
shock caused by the introduction of new tariffs. In any case, this is
not what we have seen in recent weeks, since the dollar has in fact
depreciated.
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><strong>The Mar-a-Lago Accords: A New Plaza Accords or Bretton Woods III?</strong></p>
<p>Let us now turn to the second phase of the plan: an international
agreement to reshape the global monetary system — one in which the
dollar would retain a central role while foreign states would be
compelled to accept its devaluation.</p>
<p>These accords, explicitly described by Miran as the future <em>"Mar-a-Lago
Accords,"</em><a href="#footnote-8"><sup>8</sup></a> would be the culmination of the negotiations opened by
the tariff offensive. The goal would be a broad multilateral effort to
devalue the dollar by pushing up the value of other currencies, thereby
making U.S. manufactured exports more competitive — all while preserving
the dollar's status as the key global currency.
<br />
<br />
The precedent that comes to mind is the 1985 Plaza Accords, which also
aimed to devalue the dollar through coordinated appreciation of the yen
and the Deutsche Mark. But there are two key differences. First, the
Plaza Accord was concluded between the U.S. and its subordinates,
whereas any Mar-a-Lago Accords would have to include China — now
considered the U.S.'s peer competitor. Second, the U.S. federal debt has
risen from about 40% to 126% of GDP since 1985. A dollar devaluation
could prompt many holders of U.S. Treasuries to dump their assets. To
address this risk, Miran proposes that "reserve selling can be
accompanied by term-out of remaining reserve holdings."<a href="#footnote-9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the event
of a mass sell-off of Treasuries, the U.S. could buy back a portion (via
the Federal Reserve) and either exchange them or issue new bonds with
much longer maturities — up to a hundred years, or even perpetual debt
instruments.
<br />
<br />
But why would foreign countries accept such a deal? Miran offers two
answers: the threat of tariffs, and the threat to the American security
umbrella. The broad contours of the agreement are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Such a Mar-a-Lago Accord gives form to a 21st Century version of a
multilateral currency agreement. President Trump will want foreigners
to help pay for the security zone provided by the United States. A
reduction in the value of the dollar helps create manufacturing jobs
in America and reallocates aggregate demand from the rest of the world
to the U.S. The term-out of reserve debt helps prevent financial
market volatility and the economic damage that would ensue. Multiple
goals are accomplished with one agreement."<a href="#footnote-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The threats to the U.S. security umbrella are already pushing European
countries to rearm. Of course, in the longer term, some states (notably
Germany) may seek to use this rearmament to emancipate themselves from
U.S. protection. But for now, and contrary to the prevailing discourse
that treats this rearmament as a step toward European "strategic
autonomy," it aligns perfectly with Washington's goals. It also
demonstrates that the administration's hardball diplomacy is far from
the ineffective bluster portrayed in the media. In the wake of the April
2^nd^ announcements, over 75 countries have already reached out to the
White House to open negotiations as quickly as possible.
<br />
<br />
What remains to be seen is how states outside the U.S. alliance system
will respond to these pressures. The key question is whether the
proposed Mar-a-Lago Accords will be merely a reconfiguration of the
existing monetary order — like the Plaza Accord in 1985 — or whether
they will mark the foundation of an entirely new one. It's far from
certain that such a system could be rebuilt without passing through a
phase of open military confrontation. Recall that the original Bretton
Woods conference (1944) was only possible near the end of the Second
World War, when the outcome of the conflict was clear and most of the
participating nations, aside from the U.S., were exhausted and bleeding
out.
<br />
<br />
In any case, the U.S. will be forced to resolve a fundamental issue that
the "Miran Doctrine" touches on only in passing:<a href="#footnote-11"><sup>11</sup></a> to what extent
does the American state stand behind the creation of dollars outside its
borders? During past crises (2008 and 2020), these offshore
dollars — now exceeding in volume those created domestically — have
prompted the Federal Reserve to supply dollars to allied central banks
to prevent the collapse of their banking and financial systems. In
effect, the Fed has acted as lender of last resort (and guarantor of
social peace) not just for the U.S. economy, but for much of the
American alliance network. Yet there is no binding agreement requiring
it to do so in the future. Any U.S. military disengagement from a given
region could be interpreted as a signal of financial and monetary
withdrawal as well. In this sense, the future of de-dollarization may
hang in the balance. So far, de-dollarization has proceeded mainly as
diversification — smaller currencies gaining ground against the dominant
ones. But if the Trumpian turn ultimately means restricting the dollar's
reach to a narrower portion of the globe, the rest of the world will
have to adapt. Other countries — China above all — would then be forced
to step in and guarantee financial stability in their respective
regions.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Toward a Nationalist Social Compromise?</strong></p>
<p>It is well known that the Trumpist galaxy encompasses a mix of
contradictory tendencies — from technophile anarcho-capitalism to
Christian nationalism, and even quasi-<em>völkisch</em> plebeian currents. But
once in power, Trumpism has been necessarily forced to part ways with
the cultural ferment that has revitalized it, and to stabilize around a
more realistic line of governance. That stabilization is still underway,
which explains the cloud of confusion surrounding the administration's
current behavior — and the delight of its critics. Nonetheless, the
recommendations of the "Miran Doctrine" appear to be taking concrete
shape (at least in part), while the once-inflated political importance
of a figure like Elon Musk — representative of the libertarian
wing — has already been sharply scaled back.
<br />
<br />
We have seen that Miran emphasizes the burden, rather than the
privileges, associated with the dollar. More broadly, he tends to
prioritize the American domestic context over the global economic and
military projection of the United States, especially beyond the Western
Hemisphere. This invites the question: is the Trump administration's
assertiveness an attempt to rebalance the two, at a moment when the
atrophy of the former is beginning to threaten the continuation of the
latter? Several factors suggest that this may indeed be the case.
<br />
<br />
The first point to note is that the Trump administration had most likely
anticipated that the April 2 announcements would trigger a shock in
financial markets. Without claiming that every consequence was fully
under control — especially in the bond market — it's worth noting that
the administration had factored in the market volatility its actions
would cause as early as 2025, and since then it has made little effort
to reassure investors. Trump, Lutnick, Bessent, Miran himself — they all
acknowledge that the economy will deteriorate in the short term but
insist this is the price to pay for future prosperity. The
administration's willingness to confront Wall Street head-on is now
undeniable. Moreover, this shock may be only in its early stages,
especially as the tariffs are still being phased in and further
developments could be of major significance.
<br />
<br />
Let us also recall that this is not the first time the United States has
chosen to unleash a major economic shock. The Nixon Shock of 1971 and
the Volcker Shock of 1979 come to mind. From this point of view,
comparisons with what is already being called the "Trump Shock" seem
entirely legitimate. In particular, the analogy with the Volcker
Shock — named after the then-chair of the Federal Reserve — strikes us
as the most relevant. Let us take a closer look.
<br />
<br />
By dramatically raising interest rates, the Volcker Shock triggered a
recession (1980--82) and set in motion a profound transformation of
American and global capitalism that reached its culmination some fifteen
years later. On one hand, the resulting appreciation of the dollar
encouraged large American firms to accelerate their
internationalization, investing even more heavily abroad, often at the
expense of the U.S. domestic context. On the other hand, the surge in
interest rates attracted global savings into U.S. financial markets.
Over the decades, this made the United States the sponge for the trade
surpluses of the other major exporting nations (Germany, Japan, China,
and a few others) — both as a consumer market and as a financial market
in which those surpluses were recycled. But it must be stressed that
these surpluses were not just the result of German, Japanese, Chinese,
or South Korean firms. They were also and above all the result of U.S.
firms themselves, who were among the most active participants in
globalization and the construction of global value chains.

A break with the Volcker-era path would undoubtedly involve the
repatriation of some U.S. capital invested abroad — but not only that.
In many cases, the most globalized American multinationals will be
subject to the same tariffs as foreign firms. Likewise, the latter will
be forced to relocate part of their operations to the U.S. in order to
circumvent tariffs and retain access to the American market. This means
that the Trump administration's industrial policy cannot be reduced to
the notion of <em>reshoring</em>. The tariffs will also act as an incentive for
increased foreign direct investment in the United States.
<br />
<br />
This trajectory appears to sketch the outline of a new social
compromise — one in many ways the analogue of the compromise that
Volcker set out to destroy. There are, however, two key differences.
First, the new version is strikingly nationalist in character. Second,
its economic policy measures diverge sharply from those of the New Deal
under Franklin D. Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The Trump
administration's emphasis on industrial revival echoes <a href="https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/on_productivism.pdf">Dani Rodrik's
concept of
"productivism"</a><a href="#footnote-12"><sup>12</sup></a>
— a post-globalization regime much more centered on manufacturing than
neoliberalism was, but one that, unlike Keynesianism, is defined by
supply-side rather than demand-side policies. The common misreading of
Trumpism as merely an authoritarian variant of neoliberalism stems from
this distinction.
<br />
<br />
The support of major labor unions at the onset of this economic war also
aligns with the analysis above. Just days before the declaration of
Liberation Day, the UAW was already communicating in positive terms
about the tariffs, addressing an audience of blue-collar workers
alongside union leaders. It welcomed the tariffs as a very positive
development for U.S. auto workers and hailed them as marking the
imminent end of NAFTA and the free-trade plague. It will be worth
watching figures like Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer — a
pro-labor conservative — to see whether she plays a significant role in
this administration.
<br />
<br />
With the prospect of an industrial revival on the table, the American
working class appears poised to regain numerical weight and a central
place in U.S. society. Some of the measures enacted under Biden (such as
the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act) already
pointed in this direction. What distinguishes Trump's second term is the
explicit admission that this development must come at the expense of the
rest of the world — and of America's own subordinates in particular.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The initiatives undertaken by the second Trump administration suggest
that the American state is in the process of reversing the broad
orientations it has followed for the past forty years. The arrival of
the new administration may seem to have marked this shift suddenly, but
in reality, it had been brewing gradually for many years — at least
since the Obama era.
<br />
<br />
Now, the administration has made it officially known, <em>urbi et orbi</em>,
that the old globalist orientations are no longer in effect, and that
everything must change for America to remain America. This holds true
both for foreign policy in the narrow sense and for economic policy
toward other nations — the two being intimately linked.
<br />
<br />
As for the latter, the scale of the tariffs announced and the deliberate
triggering of an economic and financial shock signal a clear intention
on the part of the American administration — or at least its key
sectors — not to stall any longer in a futile defense of the status quo,
but to initiate a thorough transformation of global capitalism. If such
a transformation is to occur, and if it requires a tactical retreat by
the American state, then the latter is plainly attempting to retain the
initiative and control of the process, leveraging the full arsenal of
its imperial tools — monetary, military, and otherwise — more or less in
line with the prescriptions of the "Miran Doctrine."
<br />
<br />
However, contrary to appearances, in this supposedly "tariff-based"
confrontation, the American state is addressing not just foreign
governments and foreign capital, but also American capital — especially
the segments invested abroad. Through this channel, it is also
addressing the subaltern classes of the entire planet, across their
various layers and fractions (the proletariat, traditional and modern
middle classes, the peasantry, etc.).
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this deliberate "shock" to the world economy — one that only
the United States is in a position to unleash — should be understood as
the first large-scale attempt to impose a reconfiguration of the
capital-labor relation on a global scale. The dice are cast.</p>

<p><em>Réalité is neither a social circle for sterile debate,
nor the premature embryo of yet another organization bound to mimic
itself endlessly. It is the dogged, still-undefined but focused effort
of those who understand that the formation of communist thought cannot
be decreed — it must be forged through the rigor of collective work.
Aware that the present cannot be grasped through the categories of the
past alone, we have been working on, week after week, from France and
Italy, the critical tools needed to read the convulsions of the
current moment. Each Sunday, a text is submitted not to opinion, but
to scrutiny — with the aim of wresting from events their political
meaning. What emerges does not aspire to doctrine, but traces a path:
that of a communism that relinquishes neither theoretical clarity nor
the materiality of the real. We publish the results of this work at
<a href="https://realite.world/">realite.world</a>.</em></p>
