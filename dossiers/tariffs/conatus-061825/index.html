<p><em>What Mexico reveals about the authoritarian reorganization of global
capital</em></p>
</center> 
<br />
<p><font style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size:55pt; font-style:regular; width: .80em; font-weight: 400; line-height: 52px; float: left; color:rgb(255, 254, 255); padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 1px; padding-left: -5px;  margin-right: -30px; margin-bottom: -5px;">I</font>n the manner of John Reed, from this side of the wall, we have
constructed a summary and expository report that we consider urgent. It
does not pretend to exhaust the complexity of the processes it analyzes
nor to offer a definitive diagnosis, but to draw an initial map of
coordinates that, for those of us who struggle from below, are
necessary. It was elaborated by a group of communist militants concerned
about the current course of the global crisis and the place that Mexico
occupies and will suffer within this violent reconfiguration of capital.
<br />
<br />
What is presented here is neither a technical inventory nor an exercise
in erudition. It is a materialist reading of the devices that traverse
the daily lives of millions: tariffs as a form of economic punishment,
austerity as internal warfare, forced migration as structural policy,
narco-capitalism as territorial management, exclusionary automation,
profitable ecocide, and debt as an infrastructure of control. Each
section of this report takes a visible phenomenon and inscribes it in
the general framework of dispossession that defines our times.
<br />
<br />
Mexico is not on the margins of this crisis: it is one of its active
frontiers. And we are not only speaking of its geographic location
between the impoverished South and the imperial North, but of its
inscription in a double frontier: the material frontier of economic,
migratory, ecological, military capital, and the nonphysical frontier of
the crisis, that threshold where forms of life become surplus, social
relations dissolve, and violence becomes naturalized as a method of
management. The Mexican State is a violent border guard.
<br />
<br />
This document seeks to intervene there — Where normality has become
unsustainable, where war is not the exception but the norm, where the
future is not disputed with promises but with organization and rupture.
The border, in this sense, is not only a limit: it is the place where
history can bifurcate.

<p>The imposition of the 25% tariff by the United States on all Mexican
exports in February 2025 should not be understood as an isolated event
or as a technical foreign policy expedient. Rather, it is the expression
of a profound mutation in contemporary forms of economic domination. Far
from protecting domestic sectors or responding to diplomatic
conjunctures, these measures are part of a structural strategy of
economic warfare, by means of which global hierarchies are reordered
under coercive mechanisms invested with commercial legality.
<br />
<br />
This policy directly affects key sectors of the Mexican economy,
including automotive, agri-food, and electronics. It generates indirect
and secondary effects on cross-border value chains, labor rhythms, and
macroeconomic stability. With more than 80% of its exports destined for
the United States,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Mexico reveals a structural dependence that
transcends the trade balance: it is a productive subordination
sedimented by decades of neoliberal integration.
<br />
<br />
But the core of the problem is not economic, but political. Tariffs
today serve the function of managing imperial decline, not by expanding
markets, but by shielding geopolitical positions through punishment and
exclusion. Protectionism does not act as a disruption of free trade, but
as its functional reverse: a way of selecting, hierarchizing, and
suffocating subordinate links when they threaten to exceed their
assigned role.
<br />
<br />
In this sense, tariffs function as disciplining devices that force
countries like Mexico to fulfill extra-trade functions, such as
migration control, border militarization, and outsourcing of security in
exchange for not being economically strangled. Economic coercion thus
becomes a technology of valorization in other ways: articulating trade
policy with territorial command and population control.
<br />
<br />
From a materialist perspective, these mechanisms must be understood as
forms of negative valorization: they do not expand capital, but
reorganize its reproduction through a logic of selective exclusion.
Social mediation through abstract labor and exchange value no longer
produces social integration, but rather functional segmentation and the
destruction of working-class identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The end of the dichotomy between employment and unemployment, the
global purchase of labor power, the new structuring of demand, and the
expansion of the activity rate are essential moments of this fluidity,
which places the contradiction between classes at the level of their
reproduction. It also implies, with regard to the determination of
class struggle, the disappearance of working-class identity as it had
been affirmed within the reproduction of capital.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this framework — the real subsumption of capital<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> — tariffs do
not oppose the market: they reconfigure it as a frontier, as a diagram
of hierarchical differentiation.
<br />
<br />
The disconnection between the valorization of capital and the
reproduction of the labor force is not a transitory mismatch, but the
dominant logic of restructured capitalism. There is no longer a stable
correspondence between accumulation, employment, and social
reproduction, but a structural mismatch that expels and fragments. As
Théorie Communiste<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup> points out, the dispersion of territories and
proletarian bodies is not dysfunction but a condition of functioning.
Crisis does not appear here as rupture, but as the normal mode of
adjustment of capital: friction as a form of persistence.
<br />
<br />
Thus, tariffs are not diplomatic symptoms or commercial deviations. They
are the economic face of a regime of social reproduction based on
regulated exclusion and functional subordination. They operate as
thresholds of economic violence, through which capital imposes
geopolitical tasks on its peripheries. In the face of this, to think of
economic war as an exception is to fail to understand that there is no
longer an economy without war.

<p>Clara Mattei<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup> has acutely argued that austerity is not simply a
fiscal tool, but a technique of internal warfare: a way of preserving
the capitalist order in the face of the threat of social alternatives.
As in the interwar period, today austerity does not only translate into
cuts, but into the deliberate abandonment of regions, the emptying of
public services, and the silent expulsion of entire populations to areas
of marginality or frontier.
<br />
<br />
In Latin America, this logic has operated as a multi-scale mechanism of
dispossession: weakening of public health and education, erosion of
formal employment, and progressive disappearance of social safety nets. More
than an adjustment policy, austerity constitutes a class rationality,
which impoverishes in a structural way and reorganizes social links
according to scarcity. Its objective is not to stabilize economies, but
to fabricate disciplined subjectivities, disposable bodies, and
disarticulated communities.
<br />
<br />
This war against reproduction does not act alone. It is articulated with
ideological devices that moralize poverty, individualize precariousness,
and naturalize deterioration as personal responsibility. In Mexico,
regressive fiscal pressure and the withdrawal of the state from welfare
functions have produced governance vacuums that are quickly filled by
parastatal, criminal or military forms of territorial control.
<br />
<br />
Far from being a technical response to budgetary emergencies,
contemporary austerity is a planned offensive against the conditions of
existence of the proletariat. It is intimately linked to the
proliferation of authoritarian logics and the reconversion of the State
into an active agent of impoverishment and fragmentation. Precarization
is not a secondary consequence, but a functional goal.
<br />
<br />
From a materialist reading, austerity is a technique of differential
management of the proletariat. It does not seek to solve a "fiscal
crisis," but to produce precarious bodies, indebted and available for
any form of residual valorization. Exclusion is no longer a failure, but
a structuring principle. It is not a matter of administering rights, but
of organizing dispossession. In this context, the State does not
disappear: it is rearming itself as the administrator of precariousness.
Its withdrawal from social functions is accompanied by its reinforcement
in military control, surveillance, and territorial segmentation.
Austerity is not merely a reduction in spending: it is an architecture
of selective violence, where the reproduction of life becomes an object
of management, control, and punishment.

<p>Forced migration from Mexico and Central America to the United States is
not a humanitarian anomaly, nor can it be thought of in isolation from
the structural forms of violence that characterize contemporary
capitalism. The figure of the migrant today condenses a central tension
of the system: he or she is at once a surplus body, a potential labor
force, and a subject that overflows state containment devices. This
figure embodies what can be called a regime of survival without
guarantees, where life is sustained not by the State, but in spite of
it, under conditions imposed by dispossession, forced mobility, and
biopolitical control.
<br />
<br />
The U.S.-Mexico border operates as a laboratory for this generalized
crisis. It is no longer a geographic line, but a population management
device. On the border, multiple forms of control
converge: safe third country agreements, militarization of the National
Guard, outsourcing of repressive functions, and cross-border detention
networks. Far from being exceptional responses, these technologies
configure a permanent regime of expulsion, illegalization, and
differential administration of life.
<br />
<br />
The migrant is not a subject without politics, but an active symptom of
the collapse of the social pact. Their transit highlights the
unfeasibility of the peripheral development model and the impossibility
of integrating vast social strata under the national order. The migrant
body becomes the target of multiple devices: border control, the
remittance economy, transnational informal labor, and geopolitical
blackmail. To migrate is not only to move: it is to interrupt the
fiction of the "State" as a legitimate container of life, rights, and
belonging.
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The migration crisis does not confront a "Mexican problem" with a "U.S.
solution." It is the localized expression of a global fracture: a system
that can no longer guarantee neither land, nor employment, nor basic
services, turns movement into a crime and survival into transgression.
According to the International Organization for Migration,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> between
January and April alone, more than 735,000 encounters with migrants were
recorded in Mexican territory, a figure that belies any episodic
interpretation.
<br />
<br />
From the critique of political economy, this forced mobility does not
represent a dysfunction, but an operative form of capital to displace,
segment, and manage its own human surplus. Capital no longer needs to
integrate all the bodies it exploits: it can marginalize them, expel
them, or use them intermittently, under precarious conditions, and then
discard them. In this framework, territory does not guarantee
citizenship: it classifies bodies, rhythms, and unequal access to life
and work.
<br />
<br />
Théorie Communiste has described this logic as a structural
disconnection between capital valorization and social reproduction.
Forced migration, in this sense, is a technique of uprooting that
fractures community ties and disciplines through intemperance. The
border does not separate two worlds: it functions as an internal
operator of capital, which differentiates, selects and channels lives
according to their residual value.
<br />
<br />
Thinking about migration under the paradigm of the survival regime not
only makes structural violence visible, but also allows us to understand
the contemporary mutations of sovereignty. In a world where the
management of scarcity becomes political, the migrant embodies the
figure-limit of the crisis: an embodied testimony that exclusion is no
longer the exception to the system, but its operational core.

<p>As Théorie Communiste and Endnotes have pointed out, capital does not
require stability and peace to accumulate. It can operate through
fragmentation, direct coercion, and the territorial organization of
death. Violence is not a failure, it is an adaptive rationality of
post-neoliberal capital. In this framework, drug trafficking appears not
as disorder, but as a structural tool for the management of the surplus
proletariat.
<br />
<br />
On a geopolitical scale, drug trafficking also functions as a device for
imperial intervention. The war on drugs justifies direct U.S.
interference in security policies, military cooperation, and border
control. This generalized militarization consolidates a model of social
warfare where crime, economy, and governance form a functional
continuum.
<br />
<br />
Drug trafficking is not limited to the trafficking of illicit goods. Its
existence makes it possible to sustain local regimes of violent land
acquisition, dominating migratory routes, informal labor markets,
strategic territories, and marginalized urban areas. Violence does not
respond to an irrational logic: it is an economic instrument of
territorial restructuring, a technology of command over surplus bodies.
<br />
<br />
This legally criminal form of valorization is not on the margins of
legal capitalist logic; rather, it radicalizes its content. In
territories where the wage and the law have collapsed as mediators, the
illegal economy operates as the nucleus that organizes social
reproduction. Proletarian life becomes subject to armed power, which
replaces the law and the wage as regulatory mechanisms.
<br />
<br />
In Mexico, this form of valorization has deeply penetrated institutions,
articulating networks that connect cartels, business sectors, security
forces and state actors. This network should not be interpreted as a
"criminal conspiracy," but as a complex form of governance, where the
distinction between legality and illegality is dissolved under criteria
of armed profitability and logistical control. The result is a regime of
overlapping sovereignties that orders daily life in terms of profitable
violence.

<p>Richard Seymour<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup> defines "disaster nationalism" as an authoritarian
way of managing the breakdown of the liberal order. It does not seek to
solve the crisis, but to dramatize it in order to impose regressive
responses: border closures, militarization of the territory, persecution
of migrants, criminalization of protest. This apocalyptic rhetoric does
not announce solutions, but the differential management of the
catastrophe as a political model. Alberto Toscano<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#8">8</a></sup> formulates it in
other terms: late fascism does not mechanically reproduce historical
fascism, but recovers its structural functions — suppression of class
conflict, restoration of order, racialized exclusion — now within
eroded democratic regimes.
<br />
<br />
This mutation manifests itself in Mexico in the form of the permanent
militarization of civilian life, the expansion of extractive projects
under rhetoric of modernization, and the systematic criminalization of
poverty. Political power allies with organized crime and the armed
forces to produce a new logic of sovereignty, where territorial control
replaces the law as a form of government. It is not a matter of
maintaining the social pact, but of administering its ruin with an iron
fist.

</p>
<p>This new type of fascism does not pretend to build consensus or future.
It is oriented to the present as an administered state of exception. Its
aesthetic is that of perpetual crisis, where surplus lives become
internal enemies, manageable only through surveillance, repression, or
abandonment. In the words of Walter Benjamin, it is politics turned into
a spectacle of death: an order that no longer promises redemption, but
punishment.
<br />
<br />
In this context, deindustrialization does not free up time or
redistribute wealth. It dismantles stable jobs, degrades working
conditions, and throws millions into precarious forms of subsistence:
underemployment, gig economy, forced migration or illicit economies.
Jasper Bernes<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#9">9</a></sup> already warned that the crisis of industrial work did
not imply its disappearance, but its reconfiguration as systemic
degradation: work without rights, without future, without community.
<br />
<br />
Mexico illustrates this shift. Converted into an assembly platform for
global value chains, it has experienced partial automation without
integration. The jobs created are fragile, poorly paid, and easily
replaceable. Added to this is an informality that affects 56% of the
employed population. The result is not a "modern" economy, but a
survival regime where productivity coexists with exclusion.
<br />
<br />
Faced with this labor crisis, the State does not redistribute: it
criminalizes. It does not protect: it militarizes. Poverty is not
recognized as a structural problem, but as a threat. Thus, the absence
of future becomes a matter of national security, and automation becomes
an instrument of expulsion, without compensation or collective horizon.
<br />
<br />
This process is not a "flaw" correctable by Keynesian policies. It is a
structural reorganization of labor as a form of subordination without
integration. The problem is not the scarcity of employment, but the
structural impossibility of reabsorbing the surplus labor force. The
logic of segmentation, surveillance, and debt replaces the wage as a
social bond.
<br />
<br />
The result is a tragic paradox: an economy that no longer needs workers
and a society that cannot survive without them. Technology does not free
time, but imposes its capture; it does not democratize life, it
disciplines it. Late fascism manages this contradiction without
resolving it, aestheticizing the ruin and displacing the crisis towards
the most vulnerable bodies.

<p>Aaron Benanav<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#10">10</a></sup> dismantles the technocratic narrative that attributes
mass unemployment to the advance of automation. What defines our era is
not an excess of productivity, but a chronic insufficiency of growth.
This "weak demand for labor" arises not from technological development,
but from the prolonged stagnation of capital, overaccumulation, and the
relative collapse of traditional industrial sectors.
<br />
<br />
Automation does not represent a liberation of human labor, but rather
its displacement without transition. Far from generating well-being or
free time, technology operates as an instrument of regressive
reorganization: it destroys stable jobs, makes those that survive more
precarious, and imposes a logic of replacement without redistribution.
Instead of integration, forced obsolescence is imposed.
<br />
<br />
Mexico embodies this paradox. The productive reconversion has inserted
it into global chains as an assembly platform. Partial automation has
not brought technological unemployment, but rather a multiplication of
fragile, poorly paid, and easily replaceable jobs. Added to this is a
structural informality that turns work into an area of risk, not
security. The State, instead of mitigating this trend, reinforces it: it
criminalizes poverty, militarizes the territory and manages exclusion as
if it were an individual deviation, not a systemic consequence. Thus,
automation is not a utopian promise of liberation, but a mechanism of
expulsion functional to capital in crisis.
<br />
<br />
What appears here as technical progress is, in reality, an expression of
the structural incapacity of capital to absorb its own labor force.
There is no crisis of employment: there is a crisis of valorization.
Capital no longer needs to, nor can it, achieve accumulation via social
integration. As Endnotes<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#11">11</a></sup> points out, abstract labor no longer
requires universalizing the wage, but managing the human surplus through
fragmentation, debt, and surveillance.
<br />
<br />
This massive expulsion from the wage relation is not accidental. It is
constitutive of the contemporary regime of accumulation, where the
subsumption of labor ceases to be expansive and becomes exclusive.
Instead of producing integration, automation produces superfluous
proletarians, bodies without a place, lives stripped of horizon.
Potential immigrants.
<br />
<br />
The result is an economy that does without workers, and a society that
cannot do without work. Technology, in this scenario, does not
democratize time: it disciplines it, captures it, turns it into debt and
algorithm. The future is not automated: it is canceled. What remains is
the differential management of ruin, under the ever-failing promise of a
progress that no longer arrives.

<p>The world burns. Environmental devastation is not a side effect of
global capitalism: it is its operative condition. Capital needs to
continually expand over new territories, unexploited raw materials, and
populations without guaranteed rights. In this framework, extractivism
— mining, energy, agriculture, or tourism — appears not as a
deviation, but as the structural matrix of accumulation in vast areas of
the Global South.
<br />
<br />
In Mexico, this logic is expressed in megaprojects such as the Maya
Train, the Interoceanic Corridor, or the expansion of the energy
frontier. These interventions not only destroy fragile ecosystems, but
also displace communities, fragment social fabric, and militarize entire
regions under the promise of "development." It is a sacrificial
ecology, where life becomes a technical obstacle and nature an
infrastructure for rent.
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/">IPCC Sixth Assessment report</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#12">12</a></sup>
warns that southern Mexico will be one of the regions most affected by
climate change: droughts, loss of biodiversity, water crisis. But these
processes do not operate alone: they are accelerated by a corporate
capture of the environmental discourse, which turns the ecological
crisis into a new frontier of valorization. Carbon credits, "green"
mining, or clean hydrogen do not solve the problem: they reorganize it
under forms of climate speculation.
<br />
<br />
Extractivism is not only an economic model: it is an authoritarian form
of government. It involves surveillance, criminalization,
militarization of territories and systematic repression against
environmental defenders. Under this logic, the Earth itself is subsumed
as a means of production, and the destruction of the living becomes
manageable, profitable, plannable. This integration of nature into
capital is not an accident: it is its logical outcome. Territorial
expansion is neither linear nor peaceful, but contradictory and violent.
Théorie Communiste has pointed out how this real subsumption of nature
produces territorial segmentation, paramilitary control, and dissolution
of community ties as conditions of accumulation.
<br />
<br />
What emerges is not a green capitalism, but a technocratic management of
collapse. The promises of sustainability and resilience function as
ideological anesthesia, while the regime of valorization reconfigures
the boundary between useful life and disposable life. As Endnotes warns,
even the climate crisis can be absorbed by capital as an opportunity for
business and control. Ecological critique cannot be limited to
correcting externalities or designing state-managed green transitions.
What is required is a break with the very logic of valorization: to
decommodify the Earth, the body, and time, before they are completely
converted into functional waste.

<p>Financialization marks a decisive shift in capital: accumulation is no
longer based primarily on the production of commodities, but on the
extraction of rent over the time of life. Credit is imposed as the key
to access to existence and debt as a political device of subjection. In
Mexico, informal microcredit, the over-indebtedness of households, and
the privatization of services illustrate this shift: according to the
ENIGH 2022, more than 75% of urban households maintain some kind of
liability and a growing proportion allocates more than 40% of its income
to interest payments.
<br />
<br />
Debt does not operate only in the economic sphere: it is a technique of
government. By individualizing collective deficiencies — health,
housing, education — it shifts responsibility from the State to the
debtor, fragments solidarity and moralizes poverty ("bad payer,"
"irresponsible"), neutralizing any structural reading. At the same time,
it provides the State with an instrument of control without resorting to
redistribution: capturing resources via financial markets while
disciplining popular consumption.
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>This regime does not oppose, but coexists with authoritarian economic
nationalism. As Merchant<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#13">13</a></sup> warns, credit can expand even under
anti-globalist discourses, because financialization and protectionism
share the function of managing inequality without questioning the logic
of valorization. The indebted homeland is sustained by indebted
citizens.
<br />
<br />
Financialization represents the integral subordination of social
reproduction to fictitious capital. Wages cease to guarantee life;
credit scoring takes their place. Endnotes stresses that exploitation
does not disappear: it is rearticulated in future contracts on the
ability to promise work and income. Subjectivity is measured, scored,
and put on value like "human collateral."
<br />
<br />
Debt, therefore, is neither a mere macroeconomic problem nor a moral
defect: it is an infrastructure of domination that captures present and
future, accelerates the rhythms of life, and dissolves the possibility
of community based on shared time. Financial inclusion does not empower:
it atomizes. By turning every need into a line of credit, it shifts
politics towards individual risk management and turns precariousness
into an insured market.
<br />
<br />
Breaking with this architecture requires de-fetishizing credit as a
"right of access" and restoring it to its status as a chain that
privatizes reproduction. As long as life depends on compound interest,
any promise of social reconstruction will be subject to the logic of
collateral. The alternative, then, is not more debt at better rates, but
to decommodify the material foundation of existence.

<p>The phenomena analyzed are not fragmentary episodes or symptoms of a
passing crisis. They are the gears of a regime of accumulation
reorganized under conditions of prolonged decomposition. Far from
announcing its collapse, capital shows its capacity to transform
imbalance into method, violence into administration, and scarcity into
technology of power. The "crisis" does not interrupt reproduction: it
structures it.
<br />
<br />
Tariffs, austerity, forced migration, narco-capitalism, exclusionary
automation, extractivism, and debt: each of these devices contributes to
the production of a political economy of expulsion, where labor is no
longer a mediator of integration, but a problem to be managed.
Populations become mobilizable surplus, borders become filters of
valorization, and bodies become functional or disposable units,
depending on the moment.
<br />
<br />
In this landscape, the frontier — economic, ecological, military,
digital — no longer delimits sovereignties: it modulates unequal access
to life and rights. As a technology of capital, it manages mobility,
segments links, redefines the reproducible. The "crisis frontier" is
not just a place: it is the global diagram of a form of domination that
normalizes war as a form of social organization.
<br />
<br />
Reformist responses — humanitarian, institutional, or technical — are
insufficient in the face of a regime that does not need to resolve
conflict, but to manage it infinitely. Even dysfunctionality can be
absorbed as an opportunity for valorization: climatic collapse, massive
migrations, structural unemployment, armed violence. Everything can be
governed, everything can be priced.
<br />
<br />
Thinking from this reality requires abandoning the fetish of
development, the nostalgia for the social state, and the fiction of
progress. It is not a matter of restoring a lost equilibrium, but of
interrupting the extended reproduction of the catastrophe. The outside
of capital is not guaranteed, but neither is it closed. It opens up
where bodies refuse to continue to be administered as waste, where time
is reappropriated, where the community refuses to become an accounting
balance.
<br />
<br />
Faced with the integral administration of ruin, the challenge is not to
govern it better, but to stop producing it.</p>
