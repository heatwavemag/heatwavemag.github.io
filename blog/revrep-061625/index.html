The National Guard stood
toe-to-toe with local LAPD in riot gear. Migra were caught escaping
hurled bricks between Compton and Paramount. Thousands of people were
marching and confronting pigs on the freeways, being met with tear gas
and less-than-lethal bullets. Señoras were vending hotdogs between battles,
on the freeway or the streets, with Palestinian flags waving alongside
Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan flags. Black and brown, masked and
evading capture, coming together in street skirmishes. Migrants getting
down with chota. Cholos tagging up detention centers. Lime e-scooters
dropped off a bridge onto police vehicles, scaring the pigs away. Youth
attacking migra with rocks, burning vehicles, unleashing their rage for
nothing less than their unrelentling audacity. A little something called
spontaneity; lumpen and prole fury directing violence against state
repression and private property.
<br />
<br />
The accumulating debris of these confrontations lay scattered in the
streets like confetti, remnants of a dignified rage decorating the
neighborhoods of a Los Angeles still in revolt. Regarding the current
landscape of struggle, Joshua Clover put it best: "Labor
struggles have in the main been diminished to ragged defensive actions,
while the riot features increasingly as the central figure of political
antagonism, a specter leaping from insurrectionary debates to anxious
governmental studies to glossy magazine covers."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> In Los Angeles, no
partisan in the communist and anarchist struggle has not been touched by
riot, revolt, or localized rebellion. The tip of the spear here has been
sharpening itself since the Watts Uprising of 1965, the 1992 LA Riots,
and the George Floyd Rebellion of 2020, ready to strike. It is the
"intransigent social centrality" Clover identified that
guides our view here, where private property becomes the means and
object of racialized prole rage. As the Berkeley pro-situationist group
1044 wrote back in 1970 (under the name Herbert Marcuse),
"The commodity is the heart of the spectacle."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> Now, as
then, the relationship of racialized proles to capital was demonstrated in
the very destruction of commodities and property. This revolt was not
about expropriation alone. It sought to burn down this techno-hellscape,
or at least its technologies. Its glimmers remain in our memory, caught
on camera and livestreams for the big ole capitalists to see:
"Let the capitalists grieve over the one million dollars in
damage."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>

</p>
<p>It's no surprise ICE was on the run. They could not quell
the revolt. For them, this was supposed to be a coordinated abduction
across multiple geographies aimed at realizing mass deportations. In
opposition to their operation were the forces of racialized prole
antagonism. Migra found sanctuary under the benevolence of the state,
with Donald J. Trump ordering the deployment of the California National
Guard, an action not seen since 1965. Fucking chumps. They rolled out
urban class war against workers, citizen and undocumented, not expecting
a blowout of resistance from the barrio, the ghetto, the hood, and the
slums surrounding Downtown. In Los Angeles, ICE raided the means of
production, circulation, and hot spots where day workers endure the
blistering sun. Garment factories, such as Ambiance Apparel. Day labor
centers. Home Depot. High school graduations. The streets. Los Angeles
proles responded with asymmetrical force: their hands, their bodies,
their writing on the wall: "Death to Amerikkka." "Fuck
ICE." "No One Is Illegal." We got a taste of a little bit of
"brown anarchy" mixed in with the community self-defense
patrols organized since Donald J. Trump's inauguration.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup>
Escalation through prole revolt was the only response to this state
terror. It was the spontaneous riot that kindled the soul of racialized
proletarians, despite Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass claiming that
"outsider agitators" caused the damage.
<br />
<br />
June 6<sup>th</sup> was the beginning. It started with the arrest of David
Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union and
United Service Workers West, during a coordinated ICE raid in Downtown
Los Angeles. Tased. Struck on the head face down on the curb.
Hospitalized. Detained. Fifteen undocumented garment workers — Zapotec
migrants — were abducted the same day and transported to a nearby
detention center. And then the next day, and the day after that.

    <figcaption>This is life in the belly of empire. The *core* on one block. The *periphery* on the next. JC, 2025</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>On June 8<sup>th</sup>, we heard from Cuauhtli, who was on the ground in Downtown
Los Angeles that week and who reported the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's beautiful to see the destruction of this urban
jungle. But just around the corner of our protest in Little Tokyo,
life went on as usual: the consumerist society. Tourists enjoyed
themselves. Hipsters took nice photos. People were partying. This is
life in the belly of empire. The <em>core</em> on one block. The <em>periphery</em>
on the next. We have the numbers, the energy, the skills to
demonstrate, occupy streets, protest, chant, march, and antagonize
migra. But we are out-organized. I asked myself, who the fuck is <em>we</em>?
Is it even possible to do anything other than the classic strategy of
mass demonstration? Getting arrested by the end of the day or going
home, to wake up to <em>the same thing</em> tomorrow? Are we prepared for
what comes after? El día después? Hopefully we live to see nothing but
earth again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These raids are part of a larger attempt at reorganizing the activity of
capital with a nationalist inflection, one that reveals fissures in its
composition. ICE carries out their activity of mass deportation while
The Geo Group profits from the capture of undocumented migrants. Though,
recent reports of "no due process" demonstrate the sidestepping of
processing centers altogether (i.e., detained migrants are being
immediately sent to countries of origin or misplaced in foreign
countries). In contrast, the unusual activity of bosses from many
workplaces — from agricultural fields in Oxnard to factories in
Ontario — their ambiguous relationship to the raids as well, where some
decide to "protect" their workers by sending them home or alerting them
to ICE presence — only to insist they work the next day. These bosses
reveal their commitment to the exploitation of international workforce
necessary to their business models, the previous status quo. In either
case, we are confronted with that adage, this contradiction between
state and capital: "We want Mexican labor, but we don't want Mexicans."

<p>June 9<sup>th</sup> is when seven hundred Marines from the 2nd Battalion, 7th
Marines at Twentynine Palms, California were deployed. The battles for
Los Angeles to defend migrant laborers and everyday working people

<p>At a time of white, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon patriotic nationalism, of
the obsession to "Make America Great Again," the attack on
racialized migrant labor is an ideological and material spectacle. The
precedent for these raids goes way back to the US deporting an estimated
one million Mexicans during the Great Depression, something called
repatriation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> In 1954, the US sanctioned Operation Wetback, an
initiative that deported an estimated one million Mexicans, citizen or
not.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup> We might remember Governor Pete Wilson's California and what
became Prop 187 in 1994, where undocumented migrants were striped from
state welfare services. In 2006, waves of ICE raids and deportations
were carried out after the largest mass demonstration for immigrant
workers — La Gran Marcha — and the "Day Without Immigrants"
on May Day, targeting Latina/o/x, Asian, and black undocumented workers
throughout the US. The connective tissue between these historical
processes and their racialized violence is the same: capital.

</p>
<p>The frontier between the US and Mexico has been a racialized geography
since its inception in 1848. It was a double land grab of Indigenous
territory mediated through war, a continued dispossession for the
expansion of capital, and the ascendency of white Anglo-American
nationalism in a historical pursuit (i.e., Manifest Destiny) to complete
the nation's desire for its "promised" land.
Cristina Beltrán suggests the following, "As the frontier
pushed ever farther west, American settlers were increasingly
encountering Mexicans — citizens of a neighboring sovereign nation and a
new racialized population to be feared, exploited, and subjugated." <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#8">8</a></sup>
She continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frontier freedom on the border was also a project invested in rescuing
the region from both Indians and Mexicans. Serving a double function,
conquest also saved the region from "Mexican misrule" — a
failure of governance defined in part by Mexico's
inability to eliminate the presence of indigeneity, turning the
territory into a "howling wilderness, trod only by
savages."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#9">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Capitalist civilization comes to the rescue, to exterminate the
barbarians at the gate who will trouble them for another two centuries,
unsettling the American Dream. As Samuel Huntington argued in 2004,
"There is no <em>Americano</em> dream. There is only the American
dream created by an Anglo-Protestant society. Mexican Americans will
share in that dream and in that society only if they dream in
English."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#10">10</a></sup> The jokes write themselves.
<br />
<br />
The existential threat of a Mexican invasion, of
"criminals" crossing the border, of Black Haitians or brown
Venezuelans finding refuge in "the first world," and
Chinese migrants finding their way across the Pacific Ocean; all these
represent not the crisis of exodus, but the catastrophe of capital
everywhere wrought by its concomitant ecological crisis. Between
racialized antagonists and the class relation, the unfolding of revolt
in Los Angeles presents to other metropolitan geographies the
possibilities for a generalized revolt against not only ICE, local
police and sheriff's departments, or a National Guard (and
a deployed Marine force), but against production and circulation, the
damage dealt to commodities and private property. This is a revolt not
convinced by Silicon Valley innovation or the circulation circuits of a
gig-based, service-based, and barely production-based racial geography.
The revolt reveals its own desire for disalienation, its angry prole
attacks against that which subdues us, dislocates us, and deprives us.
Our dispossession and targeting by ICE and the CBP are what ignites the
revolt.

</p>
<p>Hidden beneath the rhetorical (and liberal) gestures of
"Immigrant Rights" is the insurrectionary potential of the
general strike, the spontaneous or organized attack of the general
antagonism. For us, the general antagonism names those forces whose
basis for surviving in this death-world is the refusal and hostility
against the capital-relation, the state, and reactionary nationalism.
The general antagonism is the opposition to the reproduction of everyday
life based on what Marx calls the valorization process of capital.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#11">11</a></sup>
As Stefano Harney and Fred Moten gesture, "Another word for
this is communism."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#12">12</a></sup> And what are we to do or think about the
representation of state flags in the revolt and the general antagonism?
Of the signification rolling out in the form of an ambivalent national
belonging or perhaps gestures to national liberation, as sought out by
some groups?<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#13">13</a></sup> The ubiquitousness of Mexican flags in Los Angeles is
much more than an infantile nationalism, "stolen land"
rhetorical gestures, or vulgar appeals to anti-imperialist Third
Worldism, but rather, it is the antagonistic expression of racialized
migrant prole positions: its spectacle confirms the character of the
precarious form of its composition. So, what of this supposed
representation, its mere appearance in terms of its extensive
visibility? Re-Existir Media, a community info-project from the Inland
Empire, put it straightforwardly in a recent communiqué,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 in 5 "Americans" in the United States are "Hispanics."
This country depends on millions of Latin Americans to maintain its
social structure. We are the farmworkers: without us, most of the food
in the country wouldn't exist. We are the ones in retail, service, and
domestic work: no business or household would survive without our
labor. We are the logistics workers: goods and commodities would not
move without us. We are the builders and constructors: without us,
infrastructure and facilities would fall apart much sooner.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#14">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, we view "Hispanic" as a flattening term. Coined by the
Richard Nixon administration, this abstraction of the "Spanish-speaking"
population does little to think through the issues of racialized black
and indigenous people or the class relations within said group. The
national flags from Latin America being flown by all kinds of racialized
Latin American descent proles, as symbolic gesture of representation, is
juxtaposed to the self-defense against ICE and the National Guard, the
burning Waymo vehicles, and the destruction of private property in
general. Perhaps, and this is us risking the analysis here, the
appearance of an overrepresentation of Mexican flags rather than US
flags continues to show us all that the Mexican-American war has never
ended. The structure of anti-Mexican racism, and by extension
anti-Latina/o/x racism, reveals the troubled history of annexation, war,
and the regime that has desired subservient Mexican labor since 1848

lynching, and policing.

<p>Yet, the sequence of mass protest, confrontations, and revolt are not
without another reality: the police, the ICE agents, and National Guard
are overwhelmingly also of Latin American descent, or Latina/o/x. The
enemy looks like us. They are the levas who made their decision: join
them. Border Patrol is no longer a white Anglo-American majority. It is
also Mexican, con nopal en la frente. Despite this fact of enemy
demographic, its multicultural white supremacy, Re-Existir Media
continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the exponential of U.S. white nationalism, all Latin Americans
will only continue to be marked as stateless, as potential
"illegal aliens," as people without rights. Our people
have always inhabited a proximity to life outside of government. Now,
it is on us to build upon this anarchistic life, by weaponizing our
everyday fugitivity and undoing the chains that bind us to the system.
Not through proclamations of war, but through silent subversion and
quiet sabotage that render inoperable all that which subjugates us.
Chip away at the foundations, till it all falls.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#15">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ungovernable revolt means doing away with representation. To become
unrepresentable. It means being swallowed up with the general
antagonism, with the dignified rage of the racialized proles, the
nothing-to-lose lumpens, and the looters who redistribute the wealth of
what was stolen from us: time. The specter of the Sleeping Giant must
transcend itself into the general antagonism — alongside the
multiplicity of racial forms, in the barricades with compañeras/os/xs
who share a common dispossession.</p>

<p>The imaginary crisis of the border must stumble into the crisis of
capital everywhere. We find the following instructive: 1. The
destruction of Waymo "autonomous" and self-driving vehicles
is the dignified rage of Los Angeles prole desire, 2. The chokepoints of
intersections and freeways present the unfolding of tactical escalation
to the transportation of abductees, 3. The national flags waved from
Latin America by everyday lumpen and proletarian Mexicans and Central
Americans remind us of the dispossessed and hyper-exploited migrant
labor in the cracks and fissures of the formal economy, and 4. The
effectiveness of Lime e-bikes and e-scooters as obstructions, weapons,
and barricades to interrupt or destabilize ICE, police, and National
Guard activity reveals the insight of today's riot. The
direct measures against ICE patrol were those congealing themselves in
the riot, enabling the lines of attack against capital.
It's the faceless swarm striking state forces with illegal
and commercial-grade fireworks, blockades made of trash containers, and
molotovs shattering on migra patrol vehicles inspiring others to act.
The lessons here are manifold, and the cities across the US suffering
the same forms of capture — enduring ICE raids — and confronting the
state and capital are spreading. And we'll say it loud and
clear for President Donald J. Trump: We <em>are</em> the brown and migrant
invasion. Fuck your migra. Welcome are the rioters, troublemakers, and
LA foos tirando barrio.
<br />
<br />
What we might practice as communist measures peak their head in the
barricades, where the faceless whose hands throw bricks and bottles are
the same that take to task the realization of anarchy as confrontation
with the state. Hoped for are those "communist measures
[...] that repair metabolic continuity through expropriation."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#16">16</a></sup>
Though, all we witness here in this sequence of struggle is the
protracted desire to end the capitalist organization and reproduction of
everyday life as it is tied to migrant labor, one brick at a time. The
lesson here is to turn passive protest (resistance) into a generalized
revolt (attack); to construct lines of antagonism whose rage <em>might</em>
erupt into communist measures. As 1044 puts it, "An
exciting life is what remains to be constructed by the revolutionary
proletariat. Where authentic revolt does not recognize itself for what
it is, the routine of daily life reasserts itself and revolt fails to
continue." The burning of Waymo cars is only the beginning. As was seen
on a poster circulated by haters cafe, "ataquen sin
vergüenza." The battle for Los Angeles remains unfinished. <em>Heatwave</em>
puts the issue of struggle clearly, "Cycles of struggle
have the habit of reshuffling the deck, suspending time and space and
providing practical truth to the communist hypothesis: the real death of
capital is not a given, but a matter of force."<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#17">17</a></sup> This matter of
force must continue, proliferate, and spread. And it is in our
correspondence with each other where we might see our inquiry and
analysis blossom into practice.

<p>We are left with this burning question: what are <em>we</em> doing for the long
run? For some, it's continuing to show up for precarious
undocumented migrant workers, confronting state forces with everything
they've got, a la chingada. For others, it's
brushing up on a materialist theory of riot, expanding the practice of
expropriation. For the anarchist, it's testing the limit of
anarchy, asking how we foment long-term praxis in a burning city. For
the communist, it's developing rigorous inquiry into the present and
continued study of the logistics of one's geography,
locating tactical chokepoints — orienting a struggle to the path of
communism. We find each other on the streets, or not. But we find each
other. For now, perhaps that is the task at hand in the rubble of
revolt, donde la vida vale.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#18">18</a></sup> C/S</p>

<p>"The general antagonism admits neither strategy nor strategic
relations nor strategic agents. In fact, it points to the
fundamental antagonism of all as difference: clashing, contrasting,
emerging, and fading without agents or strategies. Agents with
strategies, that is, individuals, mistake all this difference for
something out of which they can fashion choices, or decisions, or
relations, which is also to say out of which they could fashion
themselves. But the general antagonism won't let you go, no matter
how hard it propels you, 'cause it's us. Your efforts at recognizing
