<p><font style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size:60pt; font-style:regular; width: .80em; font-weight: 400; line-height: 52px; float: left; color:rgb(255, 254, 255); padding-top: 13px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-left: -5px;  margin-right: -5px; margin-bottom: -5px;">W</font>riting about David Ricardo and Adam Smith, Marx was always careful to
distinguish between the history of economics and economic history,
between what these writers thought capitalism would do and what it did.
One might say, in fact, that <em>critique of political economy</em> attends to
the gap between economic ideology and the economy itself. For Marx,
error is baked in. Elites make constrained choices that lead — because
of the constrained choices of others — to unexpected and undesired
outcomes. There is a danger, therefore, in treating Stephen Miran's <em>A
User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System</em> as a guide to
the present. Even if the book were the playbook for the Trump
administration, the unfurling of such programs does not take place in a
void. As Réalité notes, Trump's tariff blitzkrieg is part of a
negotiation, a negotiation that will be determined not just by the
reaction of members of Trump's coalition but US trading partners and the
global economy.
<br />
<br />
Réalité nonetheless offers a useful portrait of one of the economic
ideologies at work in the Trump administration, and gives us insight
into the motives of some fractions of capital that have aligned with
Trump and MAGA. But when it comes to sussing out "the implications for
the international circuit of capital," they are entirely too credulous.
The main claim is that Trump intends to <em>partially</em> devalue the dollar
while retaining its status as world reserve currency, and to make US
trading partners pay more for US military protection. So far so good. It
is possible — though by no means likely — that the US can negotiate
deals with these outcomes, even if so far few countries are willing to
trade. The problem here is that Trump already showed his hand, pausing
the tariffs in the face of rising bond yields. Lack of progress in
negotiations will continue to lead to higher borrowing costs, bringing
more pressure on the administration to settle. Pyrrhic victory is the
most likely outcome.
<br />
<br />
Miran believes that the US can avoid the economic and political
consequences of such a devaluation — i.e., inflation — by reducing taxes
for lower- and middle-class households and deregulating the energy
industry, bringing down a core driver of inflation. First off, it must
be said that oil and gas companies are currently reluctant to invest in
new production because of the energy-transition underway. The fossil
fuel industry is in a double bind — new production is higher cost but
lowers prices by increasing output rendering that new production
unprofitable. Disinvestment raises prices, rendering those new fields
once again profitable. Trump's Big Beautiful Bill does not look set to
lower taxes significantly enough that the costs of the tariffs will be
offset, unless they lead to the economic growth expected. Réalité
cautions against over-estimating the "inflation" caused by such tariffs
but they forget that beyond the tariffs <em>devaluation</em> is also inflation.
If the result of the negotiations is a partial devaluation of the
dollar, prices will rise sharply. Trump was elected, in part, with a
mandate to halt inflation and keep the economy humming, but it seems
that by the time his terms ends he will have done neither. As far as
perceptions of the economy go, what consumers care about is price levels
not rates, so the fact this inflation is one-off, time-bound event is
likely to matter little. People care about how much more expensive
things are, not how quickly they are becoming expensive. How can this
become the basis for an enduring coalition?
<br />
<br />
Réalité is most credulous when it comes to the long-term implications of
Miran's détournement of the global trading system. As is well-known,
Trump promises to reindustrialize the US by means of economic
protectionism. But deindustrialization in the US and elsewhere is driven
first and foremost by automation, and not economic competition. The US
is the second-largest industrial producer by output next to China, but
its industrial labor force is far smaller. Because automation is an
ongoing process, the reindustrialization of the US due to economic
protectionism may increase industrial output, but it will not increase
industrial labor. If a big toilet-paper producer returns to a mill town
it left thirty years ago, the new factory will employ far fewer people,
and additions to the industrial labor force will, in the medium-term if
not the short-term, be offset by ongoing deindustrialization of labor
due to automation. The only way that the US could build a new industrial
working class would be by clawing back the market share taken by China.
But this would require domestic producers to compete on the global
market where tariffs are no help. This could only happen by way of a
massive (not partial) devaluation of US labor to levels competitive with
global producers — such a devaluation would be commensurate with
economic and political breakdown and surely not the basis for an
enduring "nationalist social compromise." In sum, tariff-driven
reindustrialization might increase profits for some producers but it
will not increase wages. In fact, as is noted, it requires a
<em>devaluation of labor.</em>
<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most interesting and the most unpredictable aspect of the
new economic nationalism is its confluence with military conflict. The
biggest players in Trump's coalition sell security and defense products
and services to states. Trump has massively expanded funding for defense
and security and therefore stands to enrich these companies massively.
But such profits come at the cost of other capitalists elsewhere — they
are paid for by borrowing or taxes. Perhaps the best prospect for US
capital is as armorer to the world. If the US can not only supply arms
to a world at war, but make other states pay for it, then perhaps there
is a path toward labor reindustrialization. But it is a path to hell and
likely to end in US defeat. What we see are symptoms of American
decline. The more the US fights it, the worse it will get.</p>
