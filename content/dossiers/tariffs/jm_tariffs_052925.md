100% tariffs on movies made overseas. "The Movie Industry
in America is DYING a very fast death," the president exclaimed,
pointing to the tax breaks offered to shoot overseas as "a
National Security Threat." Placing foreign movie makers in the same camp
as the government's official military enemies might seem
like classic Trumpian hyperbole. But as is often the case, the
president's social media noises are a window to a darker
reality.
<br />
<br />
Since Trump's first term and continuing into the Biden years, the U.S.
government has gradually redefined trade as a matter of national
security. This is a far cry from yesteryear's tale of
globalization. In that happy fable, trade was the outworking of a
competitive world market bound to link the globe in commercial harmony.
Reducing trade barriers and opening up national markets to the free flow
of capital would attract foreign investment, creating jobs and rising
incomes in the developing world. In turn, the multinational firms of the
rich nations would profit from these investments, expand themselves, and
continue to explore the technological frontier. Everyone wins in a
beneficent order led by its virtuous steward, the United States, avatar
of capitalist freedom.
<br />
<br />
So much for all that. In Trump's gothic rhetoric, trade is
a scene of death and dying, a Darwinian struggle for survival. In this
story, national growth happens not in cooperation with other nations,
but only at their expense. This is not a sharp break with precedent. His
predecessor, Joe Biden, shared the same worldview. So-called
"Bidenomics" doubled down on precedents from
Trump's first term, not only keeping Trump's
tariff regime against China but
[escalating](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/10/1250670539/biden-china-tariffs-electric-vehicles)
it. The centerpiece of Biden's economic agenda was historic
legislation designed to capture manufacturing investment from its
supposed allies in
[Europe](https://www.reuters.com/markets/why-us-inflation-reduction-act-has-rattled-europe-2023-02-01/)
and [East
Asia.](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/row-over-ev-subsidy-rules-overshadows-skorean-presidents-first-us-visit-2022-09-19/)
Biden's government threatened to penalize foreign producers
if they

with its official enemies in industries deemed critical for
*America's* national security. Like the Republicans, the
Democrats pursue trade by extortion. Trump II is a more rhetorically
colorful version of the same berserker nationalism that has overtaken
economic statecraft in the U.S. and dominates world politics today.
<br />
<br />
Properly contextualized, the tariffs' bumbling rollout is another
embarrassing episode in the disintegration of the U.S.-led global
economy. But their role in this saga goes mostly unremarked in current
debates around trade. Instead, mainstream commentary talks about tariff
policy on the terms established by the Trump administration. They are
evaluated as a more or less effective method for achieving its official,
public
[goals](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj9ytn_oKiNAxUwhIkEHYZ9KjUQFnoECBYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw18rNsSBD0mwmQ8gI4rhVPV).
These typically include some mix of reindustrialization and debt
reduction to be achieved by shifting demand for foreign products to home
producers.
<br />
<br />
The story goes something like this: a reinvigorated manufacturing base
will put U.S. industry on newly competitive footing, reducing the trade
deficit in the balance of payments. The U.S. will no longer need to
borrow so much, allowing a drawdown in government debt. Tariff revenue
will replace taxes, unshackling American business to unleash a new wave
of prosperity. Perhaps they will support U.S. military preparedness by
relocating critical industries inside the country, appeasing a paranoiac
defense establishment.
<br />
<br />
Can the administration pull it off? Is it economically feasible? Perhaps
a comprehensive
[Mar-a-Lago](https://www.ft.com/content/fba87dd3-514a-41c2-b2b9-ea597ffbdfbf)
accord is waiting to be unveiled, revealing Trump's master
plan to the world.
<br />
<br />
To some, it all seems so chaotic, so unplanned and incompetent that the
idea of a rational basis for it beggars the imagination. Others have
warned against the risk of
["sane-washing"](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-363-stockholm-syndrome)
Trump's agenda by imposing some grand strategy on what
might be nothing more than a historic grift. Of course
Trump's entourage is taking every chance they can to
[plunder](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-reacts-insider-trading-among-his-administration-2064336)
wherever and whatever they can, even
[fleecing](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-crypto-grift-pissing-off-200308100.html)
their own, contemptuous supporters. But to see nothing but kleptocracy
would be an overcorrection, missing the political effects of
Trumponomics beneath the official policy debates.
<br />
<br />
Tariffs are in part Trump's unique lizard-brained
obsession, an *idée fixe* of the reality TV real estate tycoon since the
1980s. But their broader historical meaning lies in the context of a
gradual collapse in capital investment and profitability that pushes
national governments to adopt ever more extreme measures in order to
continue appropriating their aliquot parts of a stagnating global pool.
This shows up in virtually every major empirical indicator. GDP [growth
rates](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/OED/oecd-members/gdp-growth-rate)
across the capitalist world have drifted downward for decades, including
in its supposedly most dynamic new centers, like China.
[Labor](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20221543)
productivity and productivity gains from
[technology](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2023/02/the-productivity-slowdown-in-advanced-economies-common-shocks-or-common-trends/) &mdash; measured
by what economists call "total factor
productivity"[^2] &mdash; have both steadily decayed as productive investment
has dried up. Such investments are decreasingly profitable for the
world's capitalists, so nation states must bribe them to
invest by throwing trillions in state money at them in the form of tax
breaks, subsidies, grants, and federal contracts. This was the point of
yesterday's enthusiasm for the celebrated return to
industrial policy in the Biden years, now but a distant memory.
<br />
<br />
Corporations, in turn, increasingly depend on [cheap
credit](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FS.AST.PRVT.GD.ZS?locations=US-1W)
to finance their activities or even just to continue existing. This is
the case with the symptomatic zombie firms, unprofitable concerns that
survive on easy credit and make up somewhere around
[20%](https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/the-trusted-professional/article/20-percent-of-largest-public-firms-now-zombies-111720)
of U.S. public companies. Consequently, the declining profitability of
capital shows up most dramatically in a permanent explosion of
government and private debt. These trends afflict not only the rich
countries, but also the middle- and low-income nations of the Global
South in which development has all but stalled out, most strikingly seen
in the phenomenon of [premature
deindustrialization](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2329194X.2024.2442177?src=recsys).
<br />
<br />
What is causing this breakdown? Consider the question of profits. Trump
thinks profits come from deals. Economists think profits would be
competed away in a fair market. Neither understands their source and
function in the broader capitalist economy as a class-based order, in
which a dominant class extracts their wealth from a coerced, toiling
majority. In this society, profits come from the protean fire of human
drives and creativity: labor-power.
<br />
<br />
If labor-power is the ultimate source of profits, then the drive to ever
higher productivity that defines the capitalist mode of production is
also its undoing. As that source is progressively displaced by more
advanced, capital-intensive production, the total amount of profits
available system-wide to reinvest and expand diminishes. The planetary
ossification of industry overwhelms the capacity of world markets to
absorb its output, intensifying the pressure of competition. Eventually
the process of accumulation reaches a limit in which the profit it is
able to produce isn't enough to further expand accumulation
on a greater scale. This, a general crisis of overaccumulation,
underlies the shattering of world capitalism today.
<br />
<br />
Global breakdown in capitalist growth is immensely destructive to
societies because it condemns them to a distributional struggle over
shrinking resources. Capitalism is based on the class opposition between
capitalists and the workers they exploit. If productivity is growing,
profits can be shared with the working population in the form of higher
real wages and salaries. But if it slows or stops, the economic surplus
goes to that class with the power to decide who gets what. Oligarchs get
richer as inequality grows more savage by the year. Institutions break
as the frail bonds that hold society together come apart. The fuse is
lit.
<br />
<br />
The elites are well aware of this. Popular rage at permanently failing
government institutions constantly threatens to boil over. The climate
crisis threatens the basis of human civilization itself. Planetary
upheaval looms. For a capitalist class whose most repulsive members now
simply run the U.S. state directly, the most prudent course is the
empowerment of domestic security and surveillance forces through an
equally empowered, unconstrained executive. Erratic tariff policies that
are unpopular even with many capitalists themselves are just part of the
deal, as Trump would probably say. In the short-term they may be
inconvenient; in the longer term, they are part of a fortification of
class power through a newly emboldened crackdown state. They may even
coerce some favorable concessions from rivals, allowing uncompetitive
industries to limp along a bit longer. In this sense they are indeed a
policy of national security.
<br />
<br />
If interstate economic conflict was notably absent in the days of
globalization, it was because the elites of all nations were getting
rich plundering their national working classes. Now, the fact that they
turn on each other like ravenous dogs is a harbinger of
capitalism's autumn, a sure sign that growth &mdash; like the
mental faculties of our rulers &mdash; is expiring.
<br />
<br />
Seen in this light, the tariffs are neither a more or less rational
policy choice, nor solely an elaborate grift. They are part of a
two-front, worldwide class war unfolding between national bourgeoisies,
on the one hand, and between them and the proletarians of their
respective countries on the other. That is, the tariffs are a recipe for
a renewed ruling class offensive on the workers of the world against a
backdrop of accelerating global decline. They express the economic
breakdown of capitalist society in political form.
